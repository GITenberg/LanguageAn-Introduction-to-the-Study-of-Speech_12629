description: '"This little book aims to give a certain perspective on the subject
  of language rather than to assemble facts about it. It has little to say of the
  ultimate psychological basis of speech and gives only enough of the actual descriptive
  or historical facts of particular languages to illustrate principles. Its main purpose
  is to show what the author conceives language to be, what is its variability in
  place and time, and what are its relations to other fundamental human interests--the
  problem of thought, the nature of the historical process, race, culture, art. The
  perspective thus gained will be useful, the author hopes, both to linguistic students
  and to the outside public that is half inclined to dismiss linguistic notions as
  the private pedantries of essentially idle minds"--Preface. (PsycINFO Database Record
